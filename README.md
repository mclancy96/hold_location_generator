# hold_location_generator
This app will generate a random hold location specific to my local Target location. 
The purpose of this app is to get a random location in our store's order pickup hold location. We could then inspect the bags in that location to see if all of the items in the bag are prepared properly and reward the team member that stowed that bag into the hold location. Ultimately, the goal was to encourage team members to make sure that they are properly stowing their orders in the hold locations.
